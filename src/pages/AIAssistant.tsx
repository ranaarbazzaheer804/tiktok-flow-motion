The product itself feels substantial - weighing about 12oz with a sleek matte finish.\n\n2/ Setup took less than 5 minutes. The app connected instantly via Bluetooth. Interface is clean but there's a learning curve with the gesture controls.\n\n3/ Battery life: Claimed 12 hours, but I'm consistently getting 10.5 hours at 70% volume.
